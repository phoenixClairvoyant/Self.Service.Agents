<h1 id="anecdotal-model">Anecdotal model</h1>
<ul>
<li>The anecdotal model of the data is expressed in a detailed, free-form textual description of the data, ideally resembling a story.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sentances of the textual description emerge out of the answers to a set of questions about the data. - The questions to be answered should be informed by the Basic Five Elements of a story: plot, actors, resolution, conflict and setting. - While formulating the Basic Five Elements of the data story, the Five W’s of Data can be a helpful thinking tool. - The Five W’s of Data are: Who, What, When, Where and Why. - The anecdotal model is not meant to be precise and may rely on a lot of assumptions. - It is worth while captureing any assumptions made. - The anecdotal model need not be exaustive, but it needs to have enough detail so that it can power the formation of the remaining models. - It is perfectly acceptable to park a partially completed anecdotal model, and do some work on the conceptual and relativistic models, before returning to continue with the anecdotal model. - This is encouraged to save on context switching while dealing with a particular set of entities.</p>

<h3 id="story-of-the-data">Story of the data</h3>
<p>Everything starts with a story, and a decision enabling system should be no exception.</p>
<p>The <strong>data story</strong>, like any real-world story consist of five elements: the actors/characters, the setting, the plot, the conflict and the resolution.</p>
<p>We can use the acronym PARCS: Plot, Actors, Resolution, Conflict and Setting, although this does not imply the best ordering.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actors</strong> : which real-world or virtual actors are involved?</li>
<li><strong>Plot</strong> : what is the progression of data over time and space?</li>
<li><strong>Setting</strong> as a description of the domain and the various “worlds” the actors inhabit.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict</strong> that there currently or potentially can exist related to the data.</li>
<li><strong>Resolution</strong>, present or future progression that resolves the conflict.</li>
</ul>
<p>PARCS is merely a guide, and the data story may comprise of more or less, or even additional components. Consult the example below for an illustration of how PARCS can be used.</p>
<h3 id="five-ws-of-data">Five W’s of data</h3>
<p>The <strong>Five W’s of data</strong> may assist us in the formation of the anecdotal model.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What</strong> data do we require?</li>
<li><strong>Where</strong> does the required data come from?</li>
<li><strong>Who</strong> is responsible for ensuring the availability and quality of the data?</li>
<li><strong>When</strong> do we receive data?</li>
<li><strong>Why</strong> do we need this specific set of data?</li>
</ul>
<p>As with PARCS, the Five W’s also serve as a guide, and in some instances only some of the W’s might apply.</p>

<h3 id="input">Input</h3>
<h4 id="story-of-the-data-1">Story of the data</h4>
<p>In a clean water network, the decision hypothesis of which supply lines need to be throttled, diverted or increased requires the input of data from various sources. The main source of input data would be the volume measurements of service reservoirs, together with the pressure and flow measurements from well dispersed sensors throughout the network. This measurement data needs to be of a time series nature, and for flow and pressure, directionality is also of importance. Directionality indicates in which direction along the supply line the water is flowing, or in which direction the pressure differential exists. Each measurement therefore needs to consist of a timestamp, a unique name/label/tag for identification and a measurement value. For each measurement tag, record needs to be kept of the engineering unit of the unit of measure the tag’s values represent. In addition, the network itself needs to be described geographically such that the concept of containment is captured. For example, a flow metered zone (FMZ) resides in a hydraulic system, which resides in a geographic area, which in turn resides in a geographic region. For each measurement tag, record need to be kept of where in the network it resides. All of this record keeping needs to account for changes over time such that it will always be possible to establish the entire state of the network at any given previous point in time. For example, in the event that the network hierarchy changes (either by the growth or reduction of the size of a hydraulic system), it should always be possible to reconstruct the original topology. Timely supply of measurement values are required, to a granularity of one measurement for each tag for every 15 minutes. Precipitation levels for various geographic areas and even down to hydraulic system level greatly influences supply and demand. This precipitation data takes the form of historic, current and 7-day forecasts, with a granularity of 5 minutes.</p>

<li>On a continuous basis, operational engineers monitor and manage the clean water supply such that demand, caused by customer consumption, is met at all times.</li>
<li>Managing the supply and demand involves, among other things, attending to abnormalities in the network such as blockages, leakages, pump or valve failures.</li>
<li>Managing supply and demand also involve throttling and redirecting flow, and switching on and off of pumps transferring water between service reservoirs.</li>
<li>Because water takes time to flow, operational engineers need to know in advance the predicted supply and demand throughout the network so that they can respond before demand exceeds supply.</li>
<li>As an added input, precipitation levels greatly affects supply and demand in the entire network, so any prediction needs to take precipitation levels into account.</li>

<h4 id="story-of-the-data-2">Story of the data</h4>
<p>Operational engineers require a global overview of the entire state of the network in the form of maps and diagrams representing the network topology. This global overview needs to contain analytics in the form of aggregations representing the current level of detail. The current level of detail is the hierarchy level at which the global overview is being viewed at: region, area, system or FMZ. Overlayed on top of the global overview, the operational engineers require colour-coded and symbology to communicate health levels of the supply and demand situation. Based on historic data, a set of data science predictive models generate a 24-hour forecast of the demand of the network, which also gets overlayed on maps and diagrams. Additionally, alerts need to be raised if the current situation is likely to lead to demand that cannot be met by the supply.</p>
