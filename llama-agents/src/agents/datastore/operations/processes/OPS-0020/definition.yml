Prerequisites:
  - "The operator must have sufficient permissions in Azure DevOps to create projects, manage teams, and repositories."
  - "The operator needs access and permissions to the Azure DevOps organization where the project will be created."
  - "The operator should have access to the repo template that will be used to create the initial repository."

Steps:
  - "Sign in to Azure DevOps using your operator credentials."
  - "Navigate to the Azure DevOps organization where the new project will be created."
  - "Click on the 'New project' button to create a new project."

  - "Choose the version control system for the project (e.g., Git)."
  - "Select the process template that aligns with the team's project management methodology."
  - "Configure optional project settings, such as project visibility, description, and avatar."
  - "Click on the 'Create' button to create the project."
  - "Navigate to the 'Project settings' to set up the project workspace and team permissions."
  - "Create required teams (e.g., `Development`, `Testing`, `Operations`, etc.)."
  - "Add expected users to the respective teams and assign appropriate permissions."
  - "Create a new repository from the repo template, or import an existing repository into the project."
  - "Configure repository settings, such as branch policies, security, and access control."
  - "Inform the team members about the new project, their team assignments, and repository details."
