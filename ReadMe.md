The project is a research into the use of Llamaindex & crewAI for the development of an LLM agent application. The goal is to create a scalable and automated way to improve the agent's performance and reasoning capabilities.

The project is still in the early stages and the following are the current capabilities and future steps:

1. Prompt tuning:
    - Example input, input schema.
    - Stractured output
2. Internal reasoning
    - Chain of thought
    - Self-heal
3. External reasoning
    - Tool calling
4. Fine-tuning
    - Memory tuning
    - Instruction tuning
5. Multi-agent
    - Chain of thought
    - Auto-reflection
    - Auto-planning

TODO:

- Use 'lamini' to improve the agent, quantitative analysis, set areas of improvement, scalable and automated.
- Create an evaluation dataset for the agent.
- Create a benchmark for the agent.
- Create a dashboard to visualize the agent's performance.
- Create a dashboard to visualize the agent's reasoning.
- Create a dashboard to visualize the agent's memory.
- Create a dashboard to visualize the agent's tool calling.
- Create a dashboard to visualize the agent's fine-tuning.
- Create a dashboard to visualize the agent's multi-agent.
